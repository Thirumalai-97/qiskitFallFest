<p>Dear reader,</p>

<p>It all started with a simple idea and a shared passion: bringing the innovation and magic of quantum computing closer to everyone. We are a group of enthusiastic students who have come together to create a unique experience for science and technology lovers, and today we want to share with you our story of how the “Qiskit Fall Fest” initiative was born and why we believe you can be part of it.</p>

<p>Our adventure began with enthusiasm for quantum computing and the ambition to share this passion with the world. Qiskit, IBM’s famous framework for quantum computing, inspired us to create something extraordinary, something that would bring students and enthusiasts around the world closer to this revolutionary technology.</p>

<p>Our motivations are simple but powerful:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Accessibility</strong>: We want to break down barriers to access to quantum computing. No matter who you are or where you come from; at Qiskit Fall Fest, you will have the opportunity to immerse yourself in this fascinating and rapidly growing field.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inspiration</strong>: We believe that the key to unlocking the potential of quantum computing is inspiration. We want participants to be inspired by the innovations and opportunities that quantum computing offers to meet the challenges of the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Community</strong>: Our initiative aims to create a global community of curious and passionate minds who collaborate and learn together. We want to build bridges between students, researchers and professionals to share knowledge and stimulate growth.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Why should you join us as an organizer or participant?</p>
