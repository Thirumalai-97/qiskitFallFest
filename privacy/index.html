  <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases.

  <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
